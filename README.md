# Regional Distribution

## Priorities:

1. Correctness.
2. Implementation time.
3. Elegance of code.
4. Anything else you think we might care about in a coding test.

## Goal:

Using the provided React application you will create React components that will display the dataset provided in `src/MOCK_DATA.js` into a table and a pie chart.

The pie chart must display the count of people grouped by `region`.

The table should display all columns except `id`.

The dataset must be searchable and filterable. The chart and table need to update to display only the filtered data.

You may include any npm package as necessary to complete the application.
